title: What's the Point of City Logos?
datetime: None
body: Not long ago, Toronto’s Globe and Mail newspaper commissioned eight graphic designers to create new logos for Toronto. The most popular design, as determined by readers’ votes, was a logo that showcased a prominent letter “T” made up of a hundred and forty small circles, which signified the city’s hundred and forty neighborhoods. Other logos had emphasized the city’s multiculturalism. One featured several cranes, in a nod to Toronto’s status as a high-rise construction capital. Perhaps the most vivid offering, though, displayed a circus tent adjacent to the text “Toronto: A Ford Brothers Production,” alluding to the recent headline-dominating antics of Mayor Rob Ford. “What no Gravy Train?” one person tweeted, in reference to Ford’s oft-repeated term for wasteful government spending. On Facebook, one comment read, “Should have made a crack pipe with directions to the hood.”

The Globe’s logo project wasn’t fashioned as a direct response to the months of negative media attention heaped upon Toronto’s mayor—who, on occasion, has found himself explaining his actions (smoking crack cocaine, among others) when standing between a podium and a backdrop that bear the city’s current insignia, a version of its modernist City Hall. But the newspaper acknowledged that the project came at an opportune time.

It’s not immediately obvious that changing a logo would change the city’s reputation, any more than changing a refrigerator’s light bulb changes its ability to keep food cold. And yet, cities persist at changing them. Jonathon Day, a professor of hospitality and tourism management at Purdue University, told me that this is understandable. “When the locals say, ‘We need a new brand,’ part of what they’re saying is that the way they’re being portrayed is not the way they see themselves,” he said. There’s a kind of cognitive dissonance to Ford’s association with Toronto, long seen as a stylish, cosmopolitan city—sort of like seeing a Tiffany & Co. next to a saloon with boarded-up windows.

City emblems can be traced to twelfth-century Europe, D’Arcy Boulton, a professor of medieval studies at the University of Notre Dame, told me. This period saw the development of heraldry, a profession that oversees the creation and regulation of coats of arms, which were displayed on the flags and shields of nobles to distinguish themselves from their opponents during chivalric competitions and on the battlefield. Much as an N.B.A. player wears a jersey on the basketball court, the practice was one part pragmatism, one part pageantry. Over the next hundred years or so, guilds, churches, and towns, which had been using monochromatic seals as their mark of authority, began adopting their own coats of arms. Think of London’s white shield with a red cross flanked by two dragons. The emblems sometimes meant different things to different people. Still, coats of arms were a useful way of identifying various groups at a time when the peasantry was largely illiterate, relying on the Church’s stained-glass images to teach them theology.

In recent decades, heraldry has been losing ground to modern graphics, as cities borrow from the logos of the corporate world. While many cities still have a coat of arms—Toronto’s, for example, displays a blue “T” on a yellow shield held upright by a beaver and bear—councils have largely let them fall by the wayside, especially as more cities have turned to a relatively new trend called destination branding, which aims to package cities, regions, and countries as marketable products to lure potential tourists and investors.

“Heraldists like myself have a deep dislike of institutions that abandon their coat of arms in favor of a logo,” Boulton said, about the recent shift. “While we don’t mind logos, we tend to feel that the traditional forms are more dignified and have a certain character that would be sad to lose. There is also a beauty in the design of arms, partially because of the rules that constrain the combinations of colors, figures, and spacing to make the design as clear and recognizable as possible, even from a distance.”

Perhaps the most famous modern city logo is the iconic “I ♥ NY” emblem, created in 1977 by the graphic designer Milton Glaser on behalf of New York State. With New York City having nearly filed for bankruptcy two years earlier, the logo was part of a strategy to revive both the state and the city’s image and, in turn, their economies, according to Miriam Greenberg, an associate professor of sociology at the University of California at Santa Cruz and the author of “Branding New York: How a City in Crisis Was Sold to the World.” The juxtaposition of stark letters with a soft heart captured both the toughness and vulnerability people loved about New York City, she said—and their deep affection for a place on the verge of collapse.

“It is possible for an artist or designer to tap into the zeitgeist and create an image that resonates at a particular moment,” Greenberg said, “but they have to be knowledgeable about what the underlying fears and issues are.” A new logo probably won’t transform a city, in other words, unless it’s part of a package of initiatives to address a city’s challenges.

Amsterdam, too, has a much-praised logo. Its “I amsterdam” campaign and matching giant letters found at various points in the city—with “I am” in red and “sterdam” in white—has come to symbolize the city’s inclusiveness. One promotional video shows a rotating cast of diverse people accompanied by the captions “I am passionate,” “I am curious,” “I am inspired,” and so on. In an academic article, Mihalis Kavaratzis and G. J. Ashworth suggested that the impetus behind the “I amsterdam” launch in 2004 was a desire to re-highlight positive aspects of the city, as a counterpoint to Amsterdam’s international reputation of having a liberal attitude toward drugs and prostitution.

New logos don’t always work out so well. During the eighties and nineties, Seattle successfully branded itself as “The Emerald City,” which was the winning epithet in a public competition. In 2001, however, the city decided to upgrade. It created a new logo: a rebus that featured an eyeball, the “@” symbol, and the letter “L” (pronounced “See-at-L”), above the slogan, “Seattle: soak it up!” Years later, a former C.E.O. of Seattle’s Convention and Visitors Bureau, Don Welsh, admitted that one of the logo’s several problems, beyond simply not resonating with people, was that it never told anyone anything unique about the city.

In 2006, the city unveiled a new tagline: “Metronatural.” Meant to encapsulate Seattle’s wealth of both urban and outdoor life, the branding effort also met its critics. “It sucks. Lose it. The quicker the better,” wrote Timothy Egan, a Seattle native and columnist at the Times. “Sounds more like a manicured, effete fellow wearing a hemp shirt—or perhaps some kind of automotive laxative,” said another dissenter. Tom Norwalk, the current C.E.O. of Seattle’s official destination-marketing organization (a revised version of the city’s Convention and Visitors Bureau), understands that the brand may have confused people more than it informed them. “We got into trouble because I think it has a totally different meaning in Germany,” he said. “A ‘nudist colony,’ I think, is how the translation came out in one newspaper. So that faded away slowly.”

In early 2013, perhaps because of its past missteps, the city’s tourism association shed all logos and taglines, opting instead for the simple phrase “Visit Seattle.”

As for Toronto, the city itself has changed since its current logo was adopted, in 1998, to mark the merging of metropolitan Toronto’s six self-governing municipalities into the present-day City of Toronto; the logo replaced an old one showing six interwoven rings. “The Toronto area gets about eighty thousand new immigrants every year,” Gabor Forgacs, a professor at Ryerson University’s Ted Rogers School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, in Toronto, told me. “I think it’s still looking for an identity, and maybe how we deal with this whole Rob Ford kerfuffle could be a formative moment for the Toronto brand.”

The city council has stripped Ford of most of his mayoral powers, and the public has the option of ousting him from office for good in October’s municipal election. Still, there’s a sense that if Toronto’s current logo, with its image of City Hall, was originally designed to broadcast a signal of dignified, centralized leadership, that’s not exactly what it’s doing at the moment.

When asked if Ford or the city council are considering an update to Toronto’s logo in light of all that’s been going on, Jennifer Wing, a spokeswoman for the City of Toronto, responded, simply, “No.”

title: Facebook gets comic roast on 10-year anniversary
datetime: None
body: The 10-year anniversary of Facebook's (FB) founding this week was an opportunity for comedians to crack some jokes at the expense of the world's biggest online social network.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reflected on the milestone in a post on Tuesday, saying he's grateful to have created a platform for family and friends to share and stay connected.

Satirical news site The Onion put together an infographic called "10 Years of Facebook."

On Feb. 4, 2004, it says, Zuckerberg, then a 19-year-old Harvard sophomore, launched Facebook "by building on classmates Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss' idea of a website where identical twins can connect."

Late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel wished Facebook a happy 10th birthday with a video showing the dark side to the social network.

Facebook sent millions of its members a notification this week that a video summary of their life so far on Facebook was ready to watch. Each user's "Look Back" video contains 15 or so of their most-liked photos, statuses, and life events set to music, the Verge reported.

CollegeHumor posted a parody video called "Honest Facebook Look Back," depicting one user's events he'd rather not relive.

Huffington Post associate editor Alexis Kleinman wrote what many people were thinking with her article titled, "Nobody Wants To See Your Facebook Look Back Video."

Wooden Nickel Shorts did a parody video depicting the Facebook "Look Back" video for troubled pop singer Justin Bieber. Based on the video, things went downhill for Bieber after he changed his hair style.

Late-night comedian Craig Ferguson compared Facebook to Los Angeles. "One was considered cool a long time ago but is still a good place to waste time with fake friends — and the other one is Facebook."

Retiring talk-show host Jay Leno got in a parting shot at Facebook. "It was on this day in 2004 that Facebook was first launched. Over the last decade, the site has reunited families, sparked romances — and taken all the legwork out of stalking. You don't have to stand outside in the cold.

body: These two charts say sell this highflying stock

Shares of LinkedIn were down 6% on Friday after the company projected a weaker-than-expected revenue outlook.

Nonetheless, the company's fourth-quarter results beat Wall Street's estimates and shares are 69% higher than they were 12 months ago and more than double what they were in 2011.

But, with shares down 10% in the last two months, is it time to buy or does LinkedIn still have more downside ahead?

"It's clearly a very expensive stock," says Pat Dorsey, Director of Research at Sanibel Captiva. "Expectations are incredibly high."

However, according to Dorsey, LinkedIn has something other social networks don't: an audience that is very dependent on the service.

"They have done a better job of any other social networking company of monetizing that user base," says Dorsey. "The real reason is because switching costs are incredibly high. If, let's imagine, a Facebook competitor showed up and you went over there, you might miss pictures of your neighbors puppy that just came on board. That's not a big deal. If you left LinkedIn, you might miss a job offer. That's a much bigger deal."

Plus, LinkedIn is also good deal for one key segment, recruiters.

"About half their revenue comes from recruiters," says Dorsey, "who find it a much faster and more efficient way to find good talent than posting boards like Monster."

Nonetheless, the company's valuations are too high, thinks Dorsey. LinkedIn price is 62 times this year's expected earnings. That's almost twice that of Facebook and four times that of the overall benchmark S&P 500 index.

"It's a wonderful, wonderful business," says Dorsey, "[but] very expensive right now."

Jeff Tomasulo, Managing Partner of Belpointe Alternative Investments, says there are some bearish signals on the chart. He notes that the stock is now testing a key support level at $200 per share but he also sees another sign of worry.

"It broke its 200-day moving average, which is never a good thing," says Tomasulo. "It's always a bearish kind of term."

And, a break below $200 could be even worse for the stock.

"That's going to be key," says Tomasulo. "If we break that, we can see more downward momentum going forward."

To see the rest of the discussion on LinkedIn with Dorsey on the fundamentals and Tomasulo on the technicals, watch the video above.

body: Not long ago, Toronto’s Globe and Mail newspaper commissioned eight graphic designers to create new logos for Toronto. The most popular design, as determined by readers’ votes, was a logo that showcased a prominent letter “T” made up of a hundred and forty small circles, which signified the city’s hundred and forty neighborhoods. Other logos had emphasized the city’s multiculturalism. One featured several cranes, in a nod to Toronto’s status as a high-rise construction capital. Perhaps the most vivid offering, though, displayed a circus tent adjacent to the text “Toronto: A Ford Brothers Production,” alluding to the recent headline-dominating antics of Mayor Rob Ford. “What no Gravy Train?” one person tweeted, in reference to Ford’s oft-repeated term for wasteful government spending.

title: Facebook lets users rewrite the past by editing their 'Look Back' videos
datetime: None
body: Let's be real here: the nostalgic "Look Back" videos Facebook rolled out for its tenth birthday are... let's say, hit or miss. Sure, some of them are tremendously meaningful. Most of them are much less so. But fear not! In the event that your Look Back video doesn't really tell your personal story (or at least not the version you want people to see), Facebook is giving you the chance to edit it.

Clicking the shiny new 'edit' button on the Look Back page lets you choose which images and status updates you want to highlight. There are, sadly, some pesky limits. As TechCrunch points out, you're stuck choosing from only a slightly wider pool of content, not the entirety of your lives on Facebook. Then again, even a bit of selective surgery could go a long way in making these videos more tolerable, so tweak away

title: This week in Tech: Five must-know things
datetime: Sat, 08 Feb 2014 14:27:11 GMT
body: This week, Microsoft finally found its chief executive and Twitter's stock received a reality check. But you may have missed all this because you were too busy checking out your friends' Look Back videos on Facebook.

Here's a review of the week in Tech:

Satya Nadella becomes the third person in the tech titan's 39-year history to assume the company's top position. After his name showed up in a series of recent reports, Nadella was confirmed by Microsoft's board of directors on Wednesday.

"During this time of transformation, there is no better person to lead Microsoft than Satya Nadella," said Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who will give up his role as chairman but stay on the board with the title of "founder and technology advisor."

So, who is Nadella? The quick bio:

Nadella's expertise in cloud computing played a big factor in Microsoft's decision to make him the new chief executive. "He's been spearheading this transition to the cloud, which is one of the things that's going right for the company," says IDC analyst Al Hilwa.

Earlier this week, Facebook celebrated a major milestone: 10 years since it first launched inside a Harvard University dormitory in 2004.

Since then, Facebook is kind of a big deal. A look at the social network by the numbers:

To help commemorate the anniversary, Facebook launched a Look Back feature that compiles users' milestones, most-liked posts and photos into a one-minute video. Then again, you probably figured this out when your Facebook feed was inundated with Look Backs.

It looks like the honeymoon is over between Twitter and investors.

After watching its stock climb from a starting price of $26 all the way to the $70 mark, Twitter shares plunged off concerns that the social network hasn't been adding users quickly enough.

Despite topping quarterly forecasts with $243 million in revenue and $9.8 million in profit, its weaker engagement figures and user growth left investors worried.

The social network now boasts 241 million monthly active users, which represents a 30% jump from last year, but it's short of Wall Street forecasts.

4. How to watch the Olympics on your mobile device

Fortunately, you don't have to be stuck in front of your television in prime time to view the latest action from this year's Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

USA TODAY's Ed Baig says NBC will live stream from all 15 Olympic venues, and most full-event replays and highlights will be available right after they wrap up.

To check out the Winter Games online, you can visit [NBCOlympics.com](http://nbcolympics.com/) or download the NBC Sports Live Extra app for iOS, Android and Windows devices. There is a catch: an authenticated cable subscription is required.

Not a fan of Facebook's current app for the iPhone? The social network has introduced a more attractive alternative.

It's called Paper, and it launched earlier this week for iOS devices. Taking a page from news reader Flipboard, Paper lets users scroll through their News Feed or stories based on a variety of topics.

The News Feed in Paper emphasizes images, as players casually swipe left to right to check out status updates or read news stories.

Paper includes many of the same features as the standard Facebook app, including the option to post updates and add likes or comments. But don't delete that Facebook app yet. Certain features aren't available in Paper, such as the ability to change your Profile or Cover photos

title: 10 Ingenious Hacks That Helped Facebook Take Over the Internet
datetime: Sat, 08 Feb 2014 14:33:09 GMT
body: Facebook’s first ten years changed the world in more ways than you think.

Earlier this week, as Mark Zuckerberg’s social network celebrated its tenth birthday, WIRED looked back on some of its biggest innovations, including the Like, the Wall, and the Timeline. But these are merely the obvious innovations — the innovations you see every time you visit Facebook on your phone, tablet, or PC. Behind the scenes, inside the massive data centers that power this worldwide social network, you’ll find all sorts of other technologies that have changed our world in very different ways — and perhaps bigger ways.

Behind the scenes, inside the massive data centers that power this worldwide social network, you’ll find all sorts of other technologies that have changed our world in very different ways

As its social network expanded to over 1.2 billion people across the globe, Facebook engineers were forced to create new software, new machines, and even new kinds of data centers capable of efficiently serving such an enormous number of souls. It was Zuckerberg’s “Hacker Way” on an epic scale.

In one sense, the company was following in the footsteps of Google and Amazon, who had faced many of the same issues in earlier years. But unlike Google and Amazon, Facebook resolved to freely share many of its innovations with the world at large, open sourcing not only software but hardware designs in an effort to help the next generation of web companies tackle a future where online services will only continue to grow.

There were also selfish reasons for Facebook sharing all this technology. If you open source something — whether it’s software code or the blue prints for a new-age computer server — others can help you improve it. But in sharing many of the sweeping software systems it built in order to juggle data across thousands computer servers — and showing the world how it honed these servers for use inside its massive operation — Facebook quite literally changed the course of the modern data center.

Yes, it had plenty of help from other companies and independent software developers along the way. But that’s largely the point. There are certainly technologies that Facebook keeps to itself, but when it comes to the data center, the company is all about collaboration. Regardless of what you may think of the Facebook social network — or its privacy policies — Zuckerberg and company should be applauded for their swashbuckling approach to hardcore engineering.

When Zuckerburg started Facebook in 2004, he built it atop an open source database called MySQL, a standard tool for web development in those days. But as the site grew to millions of users, he and his engineers needed new ways of juggling the epic amounts of data landing on their network — the endless stream of comments, Likes, photos, and other posts.

Luckily, both Amazon and Google had published research papers describing how they efficiently distributed their data across thousands of dirt-cheap machines. But while the two companies explained how their custom software worked, they kept the code to themselves. So two Facebook engineers — including Avinash Lakshman, who had worked on the Amazon paper — combined ideas from the two papers and built a new database called Cassandra. And in 2008, the company open sourced it, so that others could benefit too.

Today, Facebook relies more heavily on Hbase, another massive database based on Google’s BigTable paper. But Cassandra helped kickstart a movement towards the “NoSQL” database — a database that scales across myriad machines without being so religious about keeping the data in neat rows and columns — and this Facebook creation is still used by big-name companies like Netflix and Digg. It remains the second most popular NoSQL database and the third fastest growing database system in on the planet.

Hadoop, the open source tool that has redefined data analysis across the net, is another major Facebook success story. Based on two other Google research papers, Hadoop was originally developed at Yahoo, but Facebook is a big reason it has matured to the point where it’s a standard way of analyzing enormous amounts of data inside both web outfits and more traditional companies.

Outside of Yahoo, Facebook was one of the earliest companies to adopt Hadoop, and over the years, the social networking giant has worked to hone the platform in several significant ways. In its early days, for example, Hadoop was plagued by a rather large flaw that delayed its push into everyday businesses: a single number-crunching job could take down an entire cluster of servers. To fix this, the Facebook data team — lead by engineering vice president Jay Parikh — built a tool called Corona, which isolates processes so that no single job can take down the entire system.

At the same time, Parikh’s engineers expanded Hadoop to a truly global scale. The tool was originally designed for use on servers installed inside a single data center, but as Facebook grew, the team developed a way of running Hadoop across multiple computing centers in multiple geographical locations. The solution is called Prism — not to be confused with the NSA spying program. “It lets us move data around, wherever we want,” Parikh told us in 2012. “Prineville, Oregon. Forest City, North Carolina. Sweden.”

But this only begins to explain the company’s influence in the Hadoop world. Facebook is responsible for everything from Hive, a simple way of asking questions of Hadoop data, to Presto, a tool that lets you query as much as 250 petabtye data in near real-time.

Facebook was also instrumental in pushing the world towards tools that lets you more quickly retrieve information stored in the data center. Alongside Apple, the company was one of the first to replace old-fashioned hard disks with super fast flash cards from Utah outfit Fusion-io, and using a tool called Memcached, it spreads its most frequently accessed data across the memory subsystems inside thousands of servers, which provides even greater speed. Recently, the company pushed the use of memory systems even further with a tool called TAO.

Built by Facebook, TAO provides a single tool for storing data across both hard disks and memory. Some data is suited to hard disk storage, and some to memory, and TAO lets you do both. This sort of hybrid storage is the trend in the modern data center, and TAO simplifies things, giving you a common interface for all your data. Outside of Facebook, the concept is already being explored by the cloud database company Orchestrate.

In the early days of Facebook, Zuckerberg’s other big decision was to build his social network with PHP, one of the popular programming languages of the day. PHP lets you fashion websites relatively quickly and easily, and that’s why it rose to prominence in the mid-aughts. But there’s a rub: PHP code doesn’t run as fast as code built with languages such as C++ and Java.

That’s why a crack team of Facebook engineers went to work on a tool called HHVM — short for Hip Hop Virtual Machine. This ambitious tool converts PHP code directly into machine code on the fly, as it’s executed. The story of its creation is one of the great tales in the short history of Facebook — and it could lead to a big revival in the fortunes of PHP.

But Facebook isn’t just a software innovator. It also has a knack for breaking new ground in hardware. Like Google, Facebook now designs its own servers in an effort to cut hardware and power costs across its sprawling operation. But it also goes a step further, sharing its designs with the rest of the world through its Open Compute project.

Many were skeptical when this first happened in 2011. But the idea has gone on to significantly change the worldwide hardware market, letting companies refine not only their hardware but the supply chain that moves this hardware across the globe. Many companies are now following Facebook’s lead, going straight to Asia manufacturers for inexpensive, streamlined gear, and some are even open sourcing their own hardware work, including Microsoft and cloud company Rackspace.

Through the Open Compute project, Facebook also shared designs for entire data centers. In recent years, the company has erected computing centers that use the outside air to cool their server farms — a way of saving not only money but the environment as well. It don’t need the energy-sapping chillers that typically keep servers cool.

Facebook’s data center in Prineville, Oregon operates this way. And if you want one too, you can have it. “We’ve had some people say: ‘Can we build this data center?’” Ken Patchett, the general manager of the Prineville site, told us in 2011. “And we say: ‘Of course, you can. Do you want the blueprints?’”

In some cases, Facebook open sources designs for technology it hasn’t even built yet. A prime example: the groundbreaking modular server blueprints it released last year.

With the modular server, you can easily swap components in and out — including parts that are typically soldered to the motherboard in today’s machines. “By modularizing the design, you can rip and place the bits that need to be upgraded, but you can leave the stuff that’s still good,” Facebook hardware guru Frank Frankovsky told us last year, pointing to memory and flash storage as hardware that you don’t have to replace as often as the processor.

You can’t buy a modular server yet, but Intel and AMD –the two largest server chip makers — have designed reference systems for manufacturers. And Facebook is well on its way to installing such machines in its own data centers.

You know how you can move your laptop display forward and back and it stays right where you left it? Facebook hardware engineers have designed a contraption that lets data center technicians do the same thing with an 800-pound tray of hard drives. The Knox storage system makes it far easier for technicians to add and remove drives — even when the tray is well above their heads. Knox uses a “friction hinge” that moves up and down when you apply a small amount of force, but will stay still once you let go of it. And it too is open source.

As Facebook’s data centers continue to grow, its engineers have sought to refine nearly every piece of hardware inside these warehouse-sized buildings, and that includes the networking gear. The isn’t happy with the expensive and rather difficult-to-manage gear it gets from big-names like Cisco and Juniper, so it’s moving to “bare-metal” networking switches that can run any software Facebook wants.

We take that for granted with PCs and laptops and servers, but with networking gear, it’s a new thing. And it’s yet another major shift in the worldwide hardware market. Facebook has yet to make the move to bare-metal, but again, it is already sharing its plans with the outside world — and working with engineers from outside the company’s walls to make it happen.

One of the most surprising things you’ll find tucked into a Facebook data center: a wall of Mac Minis. In order to build and test its incredibly complex Facebook iPhone apps, the company runs server farms built from hundreds of Mac Minis, the tiny Apple machines that were supposed to sit on the desk in your home office.

Typically, developers test iPhone and iPad apps on a single machine. But with its Mini farms — which engineers can access over a network — Facebook can test its apps on a much larger scale. This too is a trend in the software industry. Outfits like Travis CI and Sauce Labs have their own Mac server farms, offering online services that let others test iPhone and iPad apps on a massive scale.

But all this is just a start. Even if Facebook never signs up another user, more and more data will flood its network, and it will need still newer ways of juggling all those Likes, photos, and videos. Just last week, the company unveiled an ambitious plan to use robots and Blu-Ray discs to manage little-used content — like the old photos you rarely look at. Yes, robots and Blu-rays. It’s completely unexpected thing. And don’t be surprised if the rest of the world follows suit
